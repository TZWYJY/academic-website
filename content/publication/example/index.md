abstract: Phonon polaritons in polar van der Waals materials enable strong electromagnetic-field confinement and enhancement for deeply subwavelength scale light-matter interactions. Here we propose and theoretically study acoustic phonon polaritons (APhPs) supported by a monolayer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) located at a few nanometers distance above a metal substrate. Compared to conventional hBN phonon polaritons, APhPs exhibit much larger polariton confinement, stronger near-field enhancement, and slower group velocity, altogether with nearly identical polariton lifetimes. These remarkable properties allow APhP-based nanoresonators to significantly enhance vibrational fingerprints of subnanometer-thick molecule layers, achieving strong coupling between molecular vibrations and APhP modes. Our work demonstrates the great potential of APhPs for exploring strong light–matter interactions at an extremely deep subwavelength-scale.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A new hBN-metal structure to support a new type of acoustic phonon polaritons, which shows strong confinement and field enhancement.
